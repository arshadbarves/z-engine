# Z Engine 2.0 user guide

Z Engine is a desktop app that works on your code with you. You describe a
task in plain language ("fix the failing login test", "explain how billing
works"), and an AI model reads files, runs commands, edits code and checks
its own work. Before it does anything that changes your machine, Z Engine
asks for your approval, unless you have told it that action is fine.

Z Engine connects to an AI model provider of your choice (OpenRouter,
Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenCode Zen, or a model running on your own computer).
The model decides what to do; Z Engine carries it out, enforces your
permission rules, records everything, and lets you undo changes.

## What Z Engine can do

- **Understand a codebase.** Ask questions; the agent searches and reads the
  code and answers with file references.
- **Change code safely.** Edits and commands pass through one permission
  gate. You approve them one by one, or write rules that approve them for you.
- **Show its evidence.** Every turn that changes files gets a badge:
  **Verified**, **Unverified** or **Failed**, based on the tests and builds
  that actually ran.
- **Undo.** Before each message you send, Z Engine takes a snapshot of your
  project files. You can rewind the code, the conversation, or both.
- **Delegate.** The agent can start helper agents (subagents) that search,
  plan, review or verify in parallel, optionally in a separate copy of your
  repository.
- **Fit your workflow.** Custom agents, slash commands, skills, hooks and
  `AGENTS.md` instruction files, including existing Claude Code `.claude/`
  folders and `CLAUDE.md` files.

## A short tour of the window

| Area | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Sidebar** (left) | At the top: **New chat** (⌘N / Ctrl+N), **Search** (⌘K / Ctrl+K, the command palette), **Home** and **Inbox**, whose badge counts what is waiting for you. Below: **Projects** (your project folders) with their git branch, number of uncommitted changes, and chats. A dot before a chat means it is working, needs you (amber), finished while you were away, or its last response didn't complete. At the bottom: the model in use, an **Update** button when a new version is ready, and **Settings** (⌘, / Ctrl+,). |
| **Title bar** | In the middle, the **island**: your **pet** (a small creature whose face shows the agent's state; at the default level it also walks onto the composer, the sidebar and the side panel while nothing needs you) and one line saying what the agent is doing, with at most one number (the elapsed time, the finished turn's duration, or a retry countdown). Click it for a card with the live steps, plan, helpers, context, cost and recent warnings. Left of it, an amber count of other chats that need you; right of it, a ring showing how full the context is. At the right, the changes button (**Review changes**, ⌘D / Ctrl+D) with the number of files this chat changed, and the side panel button. Double-click an empty part of it to maximize or restore the window. |
| **Main area** (center) | The project home when no chat is open, the chat's transcript (your messages, the agent's replies with their work folded into one line, its tool calls and a receipt under each turn), or the Inbox. |
| **Composer** (bottom) | Where you type. Above it: queued messages and attachments. In its bar: the **+** menu, the permission mode, the model with its reasoning effort, and Send (it turns into **Stop** while the agent works). An approval card or a question takes its place until you answer. |
| **Side panel** (right) | One panel with four tabs: **Changes**, **Plan**, **Agents** (helpers and jobs) and **Context** (the prompt inspector). Resize it from its left edge or let it use the whole stage. |

The project home shows starter prompts that fit the project and cards for
recent chats, uncommitted changes and project setup. The composer's **+**
menu lists what `@`, `/`, `#` and `!` do.
