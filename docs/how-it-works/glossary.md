# Glossary

Part of [How Z Engine works](README.md). Short, plain-language definitions
of the terms used on these pages, in alphabetical order. Each entry links
to the section that explains the idea in full.

## A

### Agent

The model working in a loop with tools: it reads code, runs commands and
edits files for you, then reports what it did. The agent you chat with is
the *main agent*. See [What an AI coding agent is](README.md#what-an-ai-coding-agent-is).

### API key

A secret string that lets Z Engine use your account at a
[provider](#provider). Keys are kept in `auth.json` in your config folder
or read from environment variables, and each is sent only to its own host.
See [Providers and models](features-integrations-and-safety.md#providers-and-models).

### Approval

A card that asks you before an action runs, with **Allow once**, **Always
allow…** (in this chat or in this project) and **Deny…**. It appears when
the permission check answers *ask*. See
[Permissions](features-core.md#permissions-modes-rules-and-approvals).

## B

### Background agent

A [subagent](#subagent) started with `run_in_background: true`. It runs as
a background job while the main agent keeps working, survives **Esc**, and
sends a reminder when it finishes. See
[Background jobs](features-agents-and-context.md#background-jobs).

## C

### Check

A project command that proves something about the code: a test, build,
typecheck, lint or format run. Checks are found by reading build files or
set in settings, and every run is recorded as evidence. See
[Verification](features-integrations-and-safety.md#verification).

### Checkpoint

A snapshot of your project's files, taken before each of your messages and
stored in a hidden git repository outside the project. [Rewind](#rewind)
uses it to put files back. See
[Checkpoints and rewind](features-integrations-and-safety.md#checkpoints-and-rewind).

### Command (protocol)

A typed request the app sends to the engine, such as `submit` (send a
message), `steer`, `resolveApproval` or `cancel`. Commands go in and
[events](#event) come out. See [z-engine-protocol](crates.md#z-engine-protocol).

### Compaction

Replacing the older part of a long conversation with a summary so it fits
the [context window](#context-window) again. It happens automatically near
the limit, or when you run `/compact`. See
[Compaction](features-agents-and-context.md#compaction).

### Context window

The most text, counted in [tokens](#token), that a model can read in one
request: instructions, tool list and conversation together. Unknown models
are assumed to have 128,000 tokens. See
[The context window](features-agents-and-context.md#the-context-window-and-token-estimates).

### Crate

A Rust package, the unit the code is split into. Z Engine has one crate per
responsibility, such as `z-engine-host` for everything that touches the
operating system. See [Crates](crates.md).

## E

### Effort and thinking

Some models reason step by step before they answer; that reasoning is
*thinking*, shown as a collapsible section. *Effort* (`low`, `medium`,
`high` or `max`) sets how much thinking to ask for. See
[Providers and models](features-integrations-and-safety.md#providers-and-models).

### Event

A typed message the engine sends to the app when something happens, such
as `textDelta`, `toolStarted` or `turnFinished`. The window is drawn from
events. See [From events to a screen](features-desktop-app.md#from-events-to-a-screen).

## F

### Fallback model

A backup model tried, in order, when a request to the main model still
fails after retries and before any answer text arrived. They are listed in
`model.fallbacks`. See
[Providers and models](features-integrations-and-safety.md#providers-and-models).

### Fingerprint

A short digest of the size and modification time of every project file.
If it changed after a [check](#check) ran, that check's evidence is stale.
See [Verification](features-integrations-and-safety.md#verification).

## H

### Hook

Your own script that Z Engine runs at a fixed moment, such as before a tool
runs (`PreToolUse`) or when the agent wants to stop (`Stop`). A hook can add
context, block an action or send the agent back to work. See
[Hooks](features-interaction.md#hooks).

## I

### Inbox

The app's list of what happened while you looked elsewhere: what needs you
in every chat, chats that finished in the background, and every notice in
full. See [The project home, the Inbox and first run](features-desktop-screens.md#the-project-home-the-inbox-and-first-run).

### Instruction file

A markdown file of standing instructions the agent reads in every chat:
`AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.local.md` in the project (`CLAUDE.md` and
`CLAUDE.local.md` are read too), and your own `AGENTS.md` in the config
folder. See [Instruction files](features-agents-and-context.md#instruction-files).

### Island

The pill in the middle of the title bar: the companion orb and one line
about what the agent is doing, which opens into a sheet with the details.
A ring beside it shows how full the context is. See
[The island and the companion](features-desktop-screens.md#the-island-and-the-companion).

## L

### Language server

A program that understands one programming language the way a code editor
does: where things are defined, who uses them, what does not compile.
Z Engine starts one when the agent works on a matching file. See
[Language servers](features-integrations-and-safety.md#language-servers).

### LSP

Language Server Protocol, the standard way editors talk to
[language servers](#language-server). It is also the name of the tool the
agent uses to ask them questions. See
[Language servers](features-integrations-and-safety.md#language-servers).

## M

### MCP

Model Context Protocol, an open standard for plugging extra tools, data and
prompts into AI apps. See
[MCP servers](features-integrations-and-safety.md#mcp-servers).

### MCP server

A program, started locally or reached at a URL, that offers tools,
resources and prompts over [MCP](#mcp). Its tools appear to the agent as
`mcp__<server>__<tool>`. See
[MCP servers](features-integrations-and-safety.md#mcp-servers).

### Merge-back

Bringing an isolated agent's changes from its [worktree](#worktree) into
your project. **Apply** tries a clean patch, then a three-way merge;
**Discard** throws the changes away. See
[Worktree isolation and merge-back](features-agents-and-context.md#worktree-isolation-and-merge-back).

### Model

The AI program that reads text and writes text, such as Claude or GPT. On
its own it cannot open a file or run a command; the engine does that for
it. See [What an AI coding agent is](README.md#what-an-ai-coding-agent-is).

## P

### Permission mode

The chat-wide setting for how much runs without asking: **Ask**,
**Auto-accept edits**, **Plan** (read-only) or **Bypass**. See
[Permissions](features-core.md#permissions-modes-rules-and-approvals).

### Prompt

Text given to a model to act on. Your message is a prompt, and so are the
instructions the engine writes, which are kept as markdown files in one
crate. See [z-engine-prompts](crates.md#z-engine-prompts).

### Prompt cache

The provider's short-term memory of the unchanged beginning of a request,
so the next request can read it at a lower price instead of paying for it
again. See [Prompt caching](features-agents-and-context.md#prompt-caching).

### Protocol

The shared dictionary of [commands](#command-protocol) and
[events](#event) between the app and the engine, written once in Rust and
generated as TypeScript for the window. See
[One dictionary for both languages](features-desktop-app.md#one-dictionary-for-both-languages).

### Provider

The service that runs the model, such as Anthropic, OpenRouter, OpenAI or
Ollama on your own computer. See
[Providers and models](features-integrations-and-safety.md#providers-and-models).

## R

### Repo map

A short table of contents of your code (the main functions and types, most
important first) added to the [system prompt](#system-prompt) so the agent
knows where to look. See
[The repository map](features-agents-and-context.md#the-repository-map).

### Rewind

Going back to the moment before one of your messages: the code, the
conversation, or both. See
[Checkpoints and rewind](features-integrations-and-safety.md#checkpoints-and-rewind).

### Round

One model response inside a [turn](#turn), together with the tool calls it
asks for and their results. A turn has one or more rounds. See
[Conversations, turns and rounds](features-core.md#conversations-turns-and-rounds).

### Rule

A pattern that allows, asks for or denies an action, such as
`Bash(npm test:*)` or `Read(./.env)`. Rules come from settings or from an
approval's **Always allow…**. See
[Permissions](features-core.md#permissions-modes-rules-and-approvals).

### Rule file

A markdown file under a `rules/` folder with extra instructions for the
agent. One with `globs` joins the context only once the agent works with a
matching file. See [Glob-scoped rules](features-agents-and-context.md#glob-scoped-rules).

## S

### Sandbox

An operating-system fence around shell commands: they may write only in the
project and a few safe folders, and can be kept off the network. It is off
by default. See [The sandbox](features-integrations-and-safety.md#the-sandbox).

### Session

One chat: its messages, turns, approvals and checks, stored in its own
folder so it can be reopened and resumed. See
[Sessions and persistence](features-integrations-and-safety.md#sessions-and-persistence).

### Skill

A folder with a `SKILL.md` file of instructions for one kind of task. The
agent sees a short list of skills and loads one with the `Skill` tool when
it fits. See
[Slash commands, custom commands and skills](features-interaction.md#slash-commands-custom-commands-and-skills).

### Slash command

A command you type in the composer, starting with `/`, such as `/compact`
or `/model`. Some are built in; custom ones are markdown files, and MCP
prompts appear as `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>`. See
[Slash commands, custom commands and skills](features-interaction.md#slash-commands-custom-commands-and-skills).

### Steering

A message you type while the agent is still working. It does not wait for
the turn to end: it reaches the model with the next tool results, so you
can change course midway. See
[Steering, interrupt and cancel](features-interaction.md#steering-interrupt-and-cancel).

### Stop boundary

The moment the model answers without asking for tools. Before the turn
ends, `Stop` hooks, waiting [steering](#steering) messages and
verification may send it back for another [round](#round). See
[Conversations, turns and rounds](features-core.md#conversations-turns-and-rounds).

### Subagent

A helper agent the main agent starts with the `Agent` tool for one job. It
works with its own clean context and brings back a short report. See
[Subagents](features-agents-and-context.md#subagents).

### System prompt

The standing instructions at the start of every request: base rules, your
environment, [instruction files](#instruction-file), the list of skills
and the [repo map](#repo-map). See
[One turn at a glance](README.md#one-turn-at-a-glance).

## T

### Token

The unit models read and charge by: a piece of text a few characters long
(Z Engine estimates about four characters per token). Context windows and
prices are counted in tokens. See
[The context window](features-agents-and-context.md#the-context-window-and-token-estimates).

### Tool

An action the engine offers the model, with a name and an input format,
such as `Read`, `Edit`, `Bash` or `Grep`. The engine, not the model, carries
it out. See [Tools and tool batches](features-core.md#tools-and-tool-batches).

### Tool call

The part of a model's reply that asks for a [tool](#tool) to run with given
input, for example `Read` on `src/auth.ts`. See
[Tools and tool batches](features-core.md#tools-and-tool-batches).

### Tool result

What goes back to the model after a [tool call](#tool-call): the tool's
output, or why it was denied, failed or cancelled. Every call gets exactly
one result. See [Tools and tool batches](features-core.md#tools-and-tool-batches).

### Transcript

The written record of a conversation: what you see in the chat, and the
file that keeps each subagent's own conversation (`agents/<id>.jsonl`). See
[The transcript and tool cards](features-desktop-screens.md#the-transcript-and-tool-cards).

### Turn

Everything between your message and the agent's final answer, made of one
or more [rounds](#round). It ends with an outcome, its cost and a
[verification badge](#verification-badge). See
[Conversations, turns and rounds](features-core.md#conversations-turns-and-rounds).

## V

### Verification badge

The verdict on a turn's receipt: **Verified**, **Unverified**, **Failed**
or **Not applicable** (shown only in the detailed receipt view). It comes
from recorded [checks](#check), never from what the model claims. See
[Verification](features-integrations-and-safety.md#verification).

## W

### Workspace trust

Your decision that a project folder may use its own settings, hooks, MCP
servers and extensions in full. Until you trust it, the project can only
make things stricter. See
[Settings layers and workspace trust](features-integrations-and-safety.md#settings-layers-and-workspace-trust).

### Worktree

A second working copy of your git repository, in its own folder, where an
isolated agent can change files without touching yours. See
[Worktree isolation and merge-back](features-agents-and-context.md#worktree-isolation-and-merge-back).
